# Cargo configuration for codex-rs workspace

[build]
# Use sccache for compilation caching
# This significantly speeds up rebuilds by caching compiled artifacts
# Install sccache: cargo install sccache
# Or via homebrew: brew install sccache
rustc-wrapper = "sccache"

[env]
# Disable incremental compilation in CI for better cache hits
# CARGO_INCREMENTAL is still controlled per-command in package.json for flexibility
